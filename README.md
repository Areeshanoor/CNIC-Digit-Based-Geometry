# CNIC-Digit-Based-Geometry

# Overview
This Python program is a simple shape calculator that calculates the area, perimeter, and sum of angles for a hexagon, as well as the area and perimeter for a square. The user is prompted to enter the last digit of their CNIC, and based on this input, the program performs calculations and displays the results in a repeating menu.

# Instructions
Run the Program:

Execute the program in a Python environment.

The program will prompt you to enter the last digit of your CNIC.

Menu Options:
The program displays a menu with the following options:

Hexagon: Calculates and displays the area, perimeter, and sum of angles for a hexagon.

Square: Calculates and displays the area and perimeter for a square.

Exit: Exits the program.

Hexagon Class:

The Hexagon class has methods to calculate the area, perimeter, and sum of angles.

The calcArea(), calcPeri(), calcAngleSum(), and display() methods are used for consistency.

Square Class:

The Square class has methods to calculate the area and perimeter.

The calcAreaSquare(), calcPeriSquare(), and display() methods are used for consistency.

Usage:

Input the last digit of your CNIC when prompted.

Choose options from the menu to see the calculated results for the hexagon and square.

The program uses the last digit of the CNIC to determine the side lengths of the hexagon and square.
